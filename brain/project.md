## What this is

Routa's IT configures its identity platform by asking Claude, through this MCP server. The brief is in `client/brief.md`.

## What we found out

- The admin API applies a PATCH at once and has no preview, so the server keeps its own.
- The API doesn't enforce scope: any valid token can PATCH. `whoami` says what a token is, and the server must refuse.
- `session-length-hours` takes a number, `guest-access` a string, and the `mfa.*` policies true or false.

## Rules that cost us if we break them

- A read-only token never changes a setting.
- Every change is shown before it is applied, and what is applied is what was shown.
